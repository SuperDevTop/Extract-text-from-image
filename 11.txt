“Put on a few eggs, there’s a good fellow!” Gandalf
called after him, as the hobbit stumped off to the
pantries. “And just bring out the cold chicken and
pickles!”
“Seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as I do myself!” thought Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house. By the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, he was getting very hot, and red in the face, and annoyed.
“Confusticate and bebother these dwarves!” he said
aloud. “Why don’t they come and lend a hand?” Lo and
behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door of the
kitchen, and Fili and Kili behind them, and before he
could say knife they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlour and set out everything afresh. 
Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen
dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat ona stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away), and trying to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and not in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. At last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and glasses.
“I suppose you will all stay to supper?” he said in his
politest unpressing tones.
