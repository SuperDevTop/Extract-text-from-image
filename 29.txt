of the face, because it had been in the water so long it warn’t much like a face at all. They said he was floating on his back in the water. They took him and buried him on the bank. But I warn’t comfortable long, because I happened to think of
something. I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't
float on his back, but on his face. So I knowed, then, that this warn’t pap, but a woman dressed up in a man’s clothes. So I was uncomnfortable again. I judged the old man would turn up again by-and-by, though I wished he wouldn’t.

We played robbers now and then about a month, and then I
resigned. All the boys did. We hadn't robbed nobody, we

We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drovers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them.

might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn’t worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. I didn’t
