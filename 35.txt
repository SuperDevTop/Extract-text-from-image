He unlocked the door and I cleared out, up the river bank.
I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down,
and a sprinkling of bark; so I knowed the river had begun to
rise. I reckoned I would have great times, now, if I was over
at the town. The June rise used to be always luck for me;
because as soon as that rise begins, here comes cord-wood float-
ing down, and pieces of log rafts—sometimes a dozen logs
together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them
to the wood yards and the sawmill.

I went" along up the bank with one eye out for pap and
tother one out for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all
at once, here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen
or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck. I shot head first
off of the bank, like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out
for the canoe. I just expected there’d be somebody laying
down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and
when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd raise up
and laugh at him. But it warn’t so this time. It was a drift-
canoe, sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore.
Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this—she’s
worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn’t in
sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a
gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another
idea ; I judged I’d hide her good, and then, stead of taking to
the woods when I run off, I’d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough time
tramping on foot.

It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard
the old man coming, all the time; but I got her hid; and
then I out and looked around a bunch of willows, and there
was the old man down the path apiece just drawing a bead on
a bird with his gun. So he hadn’t seen anything.

When he got along, I was hard at it tuking up a “ trot”
