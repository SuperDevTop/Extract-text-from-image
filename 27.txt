“Now we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom
Sawyer's Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name in blood.”

Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper
that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore everyboy to stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets ; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band. And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it
again he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then kave his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentied again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot, for ever.

Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of pirate books, and robber books, and every gang
that was high-toned had it.

Some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys
that told the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took
4 pencil and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says:

“Here’s Huck Finn, he hain’t got no family—what you
going to do *bout him?”

“Well, hain’t he got a father ?” says Tom Sawyer.

“Yes, he’s got a father, but you can’t never find him, these
days. He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard,
but he hain’t been seen in these parts for a year or more.”

They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out,
because they said every boy must have a family or somebody
