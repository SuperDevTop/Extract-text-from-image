Very amusing for me, very good for you—and profitable
too, very likely, if you ever get over it.”
“Sorry! I don’t want any adventures, thank you. Not
today. Good morning! But please come to tea—any time
you like! Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow! Good
bye!” With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his
round green door, and shut it as quickly as he dared, not
to seem rude. Wizards after all are wizards.
“What on earth did I ask him to tea for!” he said to
himself, as he went to the pantry. He had only just had
breakfast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of
something would do him good after his fright.
Gandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the
door, and laughing long but quietly. After a while he
stepped up, and with the spike on his staff scratched a
queer sign on the hobbit’s beautiful green front-door.
Then he strode away, just about the time when Bilbo was
finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he
had escaped adventures very well.
The next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf.
He did not remember things very well, unless he put
them down on his Engagement Tablet: like this: Gandalf
Tea Wednesday. Yesterday he had been too flustered to
do anything of the kind.
Just before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on
the front-door bell, and then he remembered! He rushed
and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and
saucer, and an extra cake or two, and ran to the door.
