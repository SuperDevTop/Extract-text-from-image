Thorin. They came back with viols as big as themselves,
and with Thorin’s harp wrapped in a green cloth. It was a
beautiful golden harp, and when Thorin struck it the
music began all at once, so sudden and sweet that Bilbo
forgot everything else, and was swept away into dark
lands under strange moons, far over The Water and very
far from his hobbit-hole under The Hill.
The dark came into the room from the little window
that opened in the side of The Hill; the firelight flick-
ered—it was April—and still they played on, while the
shadow of Gandalf’s beard wagged against the wall.

The dark filled all the room, and the fire died down,
and the shadows were lost, and still they played on. And
suddenly first one and then another began to sing as they
played, deep-throated singing of the dwarves in the deep
places of their ancient homes; and this is like a fragment of their song, if it can be like their song without their music.

Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To seek the pale enchanted gold.

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep, where dark things sleep,
In hollow halls beneath the fells.
