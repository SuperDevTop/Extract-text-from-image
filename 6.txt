know how to do it to them ? that’s the thing I want to get at. Now what do you reckon it is?”
“Well, I don’t know. But per’aps if we keep them till
they're ransomed, it means that we keep them till they're dead.”
“Now, that’s something like. That’ll answer. Why couldn’t
you said that before? We'll keep them till they're ransomed to death—and a bothersome lot they'll be, too, eating up everything and always trying to get loose.”
“ How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when
there’s a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg ?”
“A guard. Well, that is good. So somebody's got to set
up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. Ithink that’s foolishness. Why can’t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here ?”
“Because it ain't in the books so—that’s why. Now Ben
Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don’t you ?—
that’s the idea. Don't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what’s the correct thing to do? Do you reckon you ean learn ‘em anything? Not by a good deal.
No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.”
“All right. I don’t mind; but I say it’s a fool way, any-
how. Say—do we kill the women, too?”
“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn’t
leton, Kill the women? No—nobody ever saw anything in
the books like that. You fetch them to the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to them; and by-and-by they fall in love with you and never want to go home any more.”
“Well, if that’s the way, I’m agreed, but I don’t take no
stock in it. Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won't be no place for the robbers. But go ahead, I ain’t got nothing to say.”
