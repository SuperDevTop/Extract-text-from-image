I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk
enough, and I reckoned he would. I got so full of it I didn’t
notice how long I was staying, till the old man hollered and
asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.

I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about
dark. While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or
two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again.
He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter all
night, and he was a sight to look at. A body would a thought
he was Adam, he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor begun
to work, he most always went for the govment. This time he
says :

“Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it’s
like. Here’s the law a-standing ready to take a man’s son away
from him—a man’s ofvn son, which he has had all the trouble
and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising. Yes, just
as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to
work and begin to do suthin’ for him and give him a rest, the
law up and goes for him. And they eall that govment! That
ain’t all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and |
helps him to keep me out o’ my property. Here’s what the
law does. The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and
upards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and
lets him go round in clothes that ain’t fitten fora hog. They
call that govment! A man can’t get his rights in a govment
like this. Sometimes I’ve a mighty notion to just leave the
country for good and all. Yes, and I told ’em so; I told old
Thatcher so to his face. Lots of °em heard me, and can tell
what I said. Says I, for two cents I’d leave the blamed country
and never come anear it agin, Them’s the very words. I says,
look at my hat-—if you call it a hat—but the lid raises up and
the rest of it goes down till it’s below my chin, and then it ain’t
rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up
