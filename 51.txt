was white ; not like another man’s white, but a white to make
a body sick, a white to make a body’s flesh crawl—a tree-toad
white, a fish-belly white. As for his clothes—just rags, that
was all. He had one ankle resting on t’other knee; the boot
on that foot was busted, and two of his toes stuck through,
and he worked them now and then. His hat was laying on
the floor; an old black slouch with the top caved in, like a
lid.

I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me,
with his chair tilted back a little. I set the candle down, I
noticed the window was up; so he had clumb in by the shed.
He kept a-looking me all over. By-and-by he says :

“Starchy clothes—very. You think you're a good deal of

“The widow. She told me.”

“The widow, hey ?—and who told the widow she could put

“Nobody never told her.”

“Well, V’ll learn her how to meddle. And looky here—
you drop that school, you hear? I'll learn people to bring up
a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better’n
what ke is. You lemme catch you fooling around that school
again, you hear? Your mother couldn’t read, and she couldn’t
write, nuther, before she died. None of the family couldn't,
before they died. J can’t; and here you're a-swelling yourself
