and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away
into the sky, not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep
when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never
knowed it before. And how far a body can hear on the water
such nights! I heard people talking at the ferry landing. I
heard what they said, too, every word of it. One man said it
was getting towards the long days and the short nights, now.
Tother one said this warn’t one of the short ones, he reckoned
—and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they
laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told
him, and laughed, but he didn’t laugh ; he ripped out some-
thing brisk and said let him alone. The first fellow said he
‘lowed to tell it to his old woman—she would think it was pretty
good ; but he said that warn’t nothing to some things he had
said in his time. I heard one man say it was nearly three
o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn’t wait more than about a
week longer. After that, the talk got further and further away,
and I couldn’t make out the words any more, but I could hear
the mumble; and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a
long ways off.

Iwas away below the ferry now. I rose up and there was
Jackson’s Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy-
timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big
and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. There
warn’t any signs of the bar at the head—it was all under water
now,

It didn’t take me long to get there. I shot past the head
at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into
the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois
shore. I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I
knowed about ; I had to part the willow branches to get in ;
and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the
outside.
