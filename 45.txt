and it seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner.
By-and-by he raised up, part way, and listened, with his head
to one side. He says very low:

“Tramp—tramp—tramp ; that’s the dead; tramp—tramp
—tramp ; they’recoming after me ; but I won’t go— Oh, they’re
here! don’t touch me—don’t! hands off—they’re cold ; let go—
Oh, let a poor deyil alone!” .

Then he went down on all fours and crawled off begging them
to let him alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and
wallowed in under the old pine table, still a-begging; and
then he went to crying. I could hear him through the
blanket.

By-and-by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet. looking
wild, and he see me and went forme. He chased me round and
round the place with a clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death,
and saying he would kill me, and then I couldn’t come for him no
more. I begged, and told him I was only Huck, but he laughed
such a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on
chasing me up. Once when I turned short and dodged under
his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my
shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the
jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he
was all tired out, and dropped down with his back against the
door, and said he would rest a minute and then kill me. He
put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get strong,
and then he would see who was who.

So he dozed off, pretty soon. By-and-by I got the old split-
bottom chair and clumb up, as easy as I could, not to make any
noise, and got down the gun. I slipped the ramrod down it to
make sure it was loaded, and then I laid it across the turnip
barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down behind it to wait
for him to stir. And how slow and still the time did drag
along.
