stay to supper. Then the bell rang again louder than ever, and he had to run to the door. It was not four after all, it was five. Another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, before they were all inside, bowing and saying “at your service” one after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and
Gloin were their names; and very soon two purple hoods,
a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hang-
ing on the pegs, and off they marched with their broad
hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to join the
others. Already it had almost become a throng. Some
called for ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee, and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for awhile.
A big jug of coffee had just been set in the hearth, the
seed-cakes were gone, and the dwarves were starting on a
round of buttered scones, when there came—a loud
knock. Not a ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit’s beautiful green door. Somebody was banging with a stick!
Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and alto-
gether bewildered and bewuthered—this was the most
awkward Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top
of the other. More dwarves, four more! And there was
Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and laughing. He
had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also,
by the way, knocked out the secret mark that he had put
there the morning before.
