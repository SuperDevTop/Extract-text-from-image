“Well, I b’lieve you, Huck. I—I run off.”

“Jim!”

“But mind, you said you wouldn’t tell—you know you said
you wouldn’t tell, Huck.”

“Well, [did. Isaid I wouldn't, and I’llstick toit. Honest
iajun I will. People would call me a low down Ablitionist and
despise me for keeping mum—-but that don’t make no diffe-
rence. I ain’t agoing to tell, and I ain’t agoing back there
anyways. So now, le’s know all about it.”

“Well, you see, its ’uz dis way. Ole Missus—dat’s Miss
Watson—she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough,
but she awluz said she wouldn’ sell me down to Orleans. But
Tnoticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun’ de place considable,
lately, en I begin to git oneasy. Well, one night I creeps to
de do’, pooty late, en de do’ warn’t quite shet, en I hear ole
missus tell the widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans,
but she didn’ want to, but she could git eight hund’d dollars
for me, en it "uz sich a big stack o’ money she couldn’ resis’.
De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn’ do it, but I
never waited to hear de res’, I lit out mighty quick, I tell
you.

“T tuck out en shin down de hill en ‘spec to steal a skift
‘long de sho’ som’ers "bove de town, but dey wuz pedple a-
stinin’ yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper shop on de
bank to wait for everybody to go’way. Well, I wuz dah all
uight. Dey wuz somebody roun’ all de time. “Long ‘bout six
in the mawnin’, skifts begin to go by, en ‘bout eight er nine
every skift dat went ‘long wuz talkin’ ‘bout how yo’ pap come
over to de town en say you's killed. Dese las’ skifts wuz full o’
ladies en genlmen agoin’ over for to see de place. Sometimes
dey'd pull up at de sho’ en take a res’ b’fo’ dey started acrost,
so by de talk I got to know all ’bout de killin’. I ’uz powerful
sorry you's killed, Huck, but I ain’t no mo’, now.
