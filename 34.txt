through a jint o’ stove-pipe. Look at it, says I—such a hat for
me to wear—one of the wealthiest men in this town, if I could
git my rights.

“Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why,
looky here. There was a free nigger there, from Ohio; a
mulatter, most as white as a white man, He had the whitest
shirt cn you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there
ain't a man in that town that’s got as fine clothes as what he
had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed
cane—the awfullest old grey-headed nabob in the State. And
what do you think? they said he was a p’fessor in a college,

there that long yet. There, now—that’s a specimen. ‘They
call that a govment that can’t sell a free nigger till he’s been
in the State six months. Here’s a govment that calls itself a
govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a gov-
ment, and yet’s got to set stock-still for six whole months
