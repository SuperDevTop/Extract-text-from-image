been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal
sack with a string, so it wouldn’t leak no more, and took it and
my saw to the canoe again,

It was about dark, now; so I dropped the canoe down the
river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited

listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dull kind of
a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when
it’s a still night. I peeped out through the willow branches,
