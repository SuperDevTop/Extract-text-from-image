went to school the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of
used to the widow's ways, too, and they warn’t so raspy on me.
Living in a house, and sleeping in a bed, pulled on me pretty
tight, mostly, but before the cold weather I used to slide out
and sleep in the woods, sometimes, and so that was a rest to
me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so [ liked
the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming
along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she
warn't ashamed of me.

One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at
breakfast. I reached for some of it as quick as I could, to
throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but
Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed me off. She
says, “ Take your hands away, Huckleberry—what a mess you
are always making!” The widow put in a good word for me,
but that warn’t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that
well enough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried
and shaky, and wondering where it was going to fall on me,
and what it was going to be. There is ways to keep off some
kinds of bad luck, but this wasn’t one of them kind; so I never
tried to do anything, but just poked along low-spirited and on
the watch-out.

I went down the front garden and clumb over the stile,
where you go through the high board fence. There was an
inch of new snow on the ground, and I seen somebody’s tracks.
They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile
awhile, and then went on around the garden fence. It was
funny they hadn't come in, after standing around so. I
couldn't make it out. It was very curious, somehow. I was
going to follow around, but I stooped down to look at the
tracks first. I didn’t notice anything at first, but next I did.
There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails, to
keep off the devil.
