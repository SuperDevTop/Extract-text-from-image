after they had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this
fellow and took him into camp.

: I took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and
hacked it considerable, a-doing it. I fetched the pig in and
took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat
with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed—I say
ground, because it was ground-—hard packed, and no boards.
Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it,—
all I could drag—and I started it from the pig and dragged it to
the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped

you might say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek
leading out of it on the other side, that went miles away, |
don’t know where, but it didn’t go to the river. The meal
sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. |
