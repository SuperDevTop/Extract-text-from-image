at the far end of the cabin behind ¢he table, to keep the wind
from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle’ ont.
I got under the table and raised the blanket and went to
work to saw a section of the big bottom log out, big enough to
let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting
towards the end of it when I heard pap’s gun in the woods. 1
got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and
hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in

Pap warn't in a good humour—so he was his natural self.
He said he was down to town, and everything was going wrong.
His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get
the money, if they ever got started on the trial; but then
there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher
knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there'd be
another trial to get me away from him and give me to the

to go back to the widow's any more and he so cramped up, and
siviljsed, as they called it. ‘Then the old man got to cussing,

when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.

He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said
he would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game
on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off, to stow me
in, where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn’
find me, ‘That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for
I reckoned I wouldn't stay on hand till he got that
chance.
