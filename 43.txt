time I was most down to the foot of the island. A little ripply,
cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the
night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and
brung her nose to shore ; then I got my gun and slipped out
and into the edge of the woods. I set down there on a log and
looked out through the leaves. I sge the moon go off watch
and the darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little
while I see a pale streak over the tree-tops, and knowed the
