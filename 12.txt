“Carefully! Carefully!” he said. “It is not like you,
Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, and then open
the door like a pop-gun! Let me introduce Bifur, Bofur,
Bombur, and especially Thorin!”
“At your service!” said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur
standing in a row. Then they hung up two yellow hoods
and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with a long
silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself, who was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo’s mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted “pray don’t mention it,” and stopped frowning.
“Now we are all here!” said Gandalf, looking at the
row of thirteen hoods—the best detachable party
hoods—and his own hat hanging on the pegs. “Quite a
merry gathering! I hope there is something left for the
late-comers to eat and drink! What’s that? Tea! No thank
you! A little red wine, I think for me.”
“And for me,” said Thorin.
“And raspberry jam and apple-tart,” said Bifur.
“And mince-pies and cheese,” said Bofur.
“And pork-pie and salad,” said Bombur.s
“And more cakes—and ale—and coffee, if you don’t
mind,” called the other dwarves through the door.
