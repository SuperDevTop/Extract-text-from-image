“Of course!” said Thorin. “And after. We shan’t get
through the business till late, and we must have some
music first. Now to clear up!”

Thereupon the twelve dwarves—not Thorin, he was
too important, and stayed talking to Gandalf —jumped
to their feet, and made tall piles of all the things. Off they
went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates,
each with a bottle on the top, with one hand, while the
hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with fright:
“please be careful!” and “please, don’t trouble! I can
manage.” But the dwarves only started to sing:

Chip the glasses and crack the plates!
Blunt the knives and bend the forks!
That’s what Bilbo Baggins hates—
Smash the bottles and burn the corks!

Cut the cloth and tread on the fat!
Pour the milk on the pantry floor!

Leave the bones on the bedroom mat!
Splash the wine on every door!

Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl;
Pound them up with a thumping pole;
And when you've finished, if any are whole,
Send them down the hall to roll!

That’s what Bilbo Baggins hates!
So, carefully! carefully with the plates!
