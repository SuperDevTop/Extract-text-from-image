diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came
undone till ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell
such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and gob-
lins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows’ sons? Not the man that used to
make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember
those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer’s
Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and
snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the
twilight all evening!” You will notice already that
Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. “Dear me!” he went on. “Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures? Anything from climbing trees to visiting elves—or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless
me, life used to be quite inter—I mean, you used to upset
things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your
pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business.”
“Where else should I be?” said the wizard. “All the
same I am pleased to find you remember something
about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly,
at any rate, and that is not without hope. Indeed for your old grandfather Took’s sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for.”
“I beg your pardon, I haven’t asked for anything!”
“Yes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I give it you.
In fact I will go so far as to send you on this adventure.
