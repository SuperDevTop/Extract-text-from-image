work. ‘There was an old horse-blanket. nailed against the logs
at the far end of the cabin behind ¢he table, to keep the wind
from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle’ out,
1 got under the table and raised the blanket and went to
work to saw a section of the big bettom log out, big enough to
let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting
towards the end of it when I heard pap’s gun in the woods. I
got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and
hid my su, and pretty soon pap come in.

Pap warn't in a good humour—so he was his natural self.
He said he was down to town, and everything was going wrong.
His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get
the money, if they ever got started on the trial but then
there was ways to put it off long time, and Judge Thateh
knowed how todo it. And he said people allowed there'd be
another trial to get me away from him and give me to the
widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win, this
time. ‘This shook me up considerable, because I didn’t want
to go back to the widow's any more and he so cramped up, and
jsed, as they called it. ‘Then the old man got to cussing,
and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and
then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped
any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss
all round, including « considerable parcel of people which he
didn’t know the names of, and so called them what’s-his-name,
when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.

He said he would like to see the widow get me. He suid
he would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game
on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off, to stow me
in, where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn't
find me. ‘Thut made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a
minute ; I reckoned I wouldn't stay on hand till he got that
chance.
