sonow he raised a howl that fairly made a body’s hair raise,
and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his
toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had
ever done previous. He said so his own self, afterwards. He
had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it
laid over him, too; but Ireckon that was sort of piling it on,
maybe.

After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough
whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens, hat
was always his word. I judged he would be blind drunk in
about an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself
out, one or t’other. He drank and drank, and tumbled down
o his blankets, by-and-by ; but luck didn’t run my way. He
didn’t go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned, and
moaned, and thrashed around this way and that, for a long time.
At last I got so sleepy I couldn’t keep my eyes open, all I
could do, and so before [ knowed what I was about I was sound
asleep, and the candle burning.

I don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden
there was an awful scream and [ was up. There was pap,
looking wild and skipping around every which way and yelling
about snakes. He said they was crawling up his legs; and
then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit:
him on the cheek—but I couldn’t see no snakes. He started
and run round and round the cabin hollering “ take him off!
take him off ! he’s biting me on the neck!” I never see a man
look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and
fell down panting; then he rolled over and over, wonderful
fast, kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing
at the air with his hands, and screaming, and saying there was
‘evils ahold of him. He wore out, by-and-by, and laid still a
vhile, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn’t make a sound.
U could hear the owls and the wolves, away off in the woods
