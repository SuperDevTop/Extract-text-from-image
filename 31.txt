till at last it was over the banks. The water was three or four
foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Illinois
bottom. On that side it was a good many miles wide ; but on
the Missouri side it was the same old distance across—a half
a mile—because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high
bluffs.

Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe. It
was mighty cogl and shady in the deep woods even if the sun
was blazing outside. We went winding in and out amongst the
trees ; and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back
away and go some other way. Well, on every old broken-down
tree you could see rabbits, and snakes, and such things; and
when the island had been overflowed a day or two, they got so
tame, on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right
up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the
snakes. and turtles—they would slide off in the water. The
ridge our cavern was in was full of them. We coulda had pets
enough if we'd wanted them.

One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft—nice
pine planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or six-
teen foot long, and the top stood above water six or seven
inches, a solid level floor. We could see saw-logs go by in the
daylight, sometimes, but we let them go; we didn’t show our-
selves in daylight.

Another night, when we was up at the head of the island,
just before daylight, here comes a frame house down, on the
west side. She was a two-storey, and tilted over, considerable.
We paddled out and got aboard—clumb in at an upstairs win-
dow. But it was too dark to see yet, so we made the canoe
fast and set in her to wait for daylight.

The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the
island. Then we looked in at the window. We could make ,
out a bed, and a table, and two old chairs, and lots of things
