was as big as two or three rooms bunched together, and Jim
could stand up straight in it. It was cool in there. Jim was
for putting our traps in there, right away, but I said we didn’t
want to be climbing up and down there all the time.

Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had
all the traps In the cavern, we could rush there if anybody
was to come to the island, and they would never find us with-
out dogs. And besides, he said them little birds had said it

So we went back and got the canoe and paddled up abreast

We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our

that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby ;
and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees
down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a
perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches
to tossing their arms as if they was just wild; and next, when
it was just about the bluest and blackest—fst ! it was as bright
as glory and you'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging
